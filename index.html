          Welcome to my website! I'm a rising junior at Swarthmore College studying CS and Biology. 
          I'm interested in Software Engineering, Computational Biology, Machine Learning, and more. 
          I'm a military brat and have moved 12+ times— I've lived in 9 states and 3 countries! 
          I adapt readily to new environments and love experiencing the different cultures and communities that each place has to offer. 
          Scroll to learn more about me and my journey!

      <!-- <p>Student Researcher  [Jan 2023 - Present]<br>
      I currently work as a research fellow in the Conservation Biology Lab at Swarthmore College. 
      Our lab focuses on frogs' skin microbiome and how environmental factors (rising temperatures, water quality, chemical pollution) can affect them. 
      This summer, our lab conducted field research in Chamela, Mexico and data analysis in Mexico City, Mexico.<br><br>
      
      Student Academic Mentor  [Aug 2022 - Present]<br>
      I am trained to work with Swarthmore College's student body to help them develop skills necessary to academic success. 
      This includes guiding students with time management, organization, study strategies, utilizing campus resources, and more. 
      I am also specifically assigned to a group of around 30 freshmen to mentor them throughout their first year in college.<br><br>
      
      Student Researcher  [Jan 2022 - July 2022]<br>
      I worked with Professor Qu and other students as a research fellow in the Qu Lab at Swarthmore College.
      The lab's research was focused on machine learning and brain-computer interfaces.
      I reviewed scientific papers, wrote programs to organize various sets of data, and revised both code and papers to prepare for submission to conferences.<br><br>
      
      Private Tutor  [May 2021 - Sept 2021]<br>
      I tutored students at Camp Humphreys, a US Army base located in South Korea, where there are very few academic resources for students to utilize.
      I tutored 6-8 students, ranging from 2nd-11th grade in SAT, ACT, Math (Elementary, Algebra I and II, Geometry, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus I), Science (AP Biology), and English.
      I developed a personalized summer curriculum for each student based on their needs and expectations.<br><br>
      
      Student Researcher  [Sept 2019 - May 2020]<br>
      I conducted Biology research as part of the Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, a STEM program sponsored by the Department of Defense.
      I researched the effect of various meditation techniques on the quality of sleep using smartwatch technology.
      Afterwards, I analyzed how the data compared to that of previous research.
      I presented my findings to a regional judge panel in Okinawa, Japan and placed 2nd.
